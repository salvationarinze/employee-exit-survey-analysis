# Employee Exit Survey Analysis
Cleaning and Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys

In this project, I worked with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

In this project, I played the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:

    Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
    Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

They want me to combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers.

A data dictionary wasn't provided with the dataset. For this project, we'll use our general knowledge to define the columns.

Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the dete_survey.csv:

    ID: An id used to identify the participant of the survey
    SeparationType: The reason why the person's employment ended
    Cease Date: The year or month the person's employment ended
    DETE Start Date: The year the person began employment with the DETE

Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the tafe_survey.csv:

    Record ID: An id used to identify the participant of the survey
    Reason for ceasing employment: The reason why the person's employment ended
    LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years): The length of the person's employment (in years)
